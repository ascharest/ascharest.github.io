excerpt: Words and phrases I use too much in my academic writing.

While writing the book and editing a couple of R&Rs for resubmission, I noticed some lexical go-tos and phrases that are standing out as potentially overused. I wrote them on a post-it with the title "Watch out for" and put it on my wall by my writing desk. Turns out it make a pretty great poem and maybe should just stand in for the introduction to my book...

* Thus
* as a sort of
* neoliberal practice
* The present study
* interrogates
* attends to
* renders visible
* / -- (punctuation)
* matrix
* violence and precarity
