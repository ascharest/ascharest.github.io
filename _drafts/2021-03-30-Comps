title: The Comprehensive Exam

I have various PhD students in the early stages of composing the reading lists for comprehensive exams, which means I am writing a lot of "how-to" advice. Here, I'm compiling that information for future advisees, and I'll keep it up to date as time goes on. Before diving into my advice, here are some great resources:

* U of Arkansas English Department [Guidelines](https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/english/_resources/graduate/ma-phd-english/guidelines-phd-written-exam-reading-lists.pdf) (fantastic program-specific advice)
* U Toronto Geography, "[Demystifying Comps](https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/english/_resources/graduate/ma-phd-english/guidelines-phd-written-exam-reading-lists.pdf)" (for geography students, but great tips)
* Experience of one PhD, [Lisa-Marie Pierre](https://lisamariepierre.com/phdingwhile-taking-comprehensive-exams/)

Before considering general advice, it is important to remember two things. First, always check your  program's guidelines. There are many program-specific expectations, including the number of texts that should be included on a reading list, the format and page length of the proposal, particular topics that must be addressed, etc. Likewise, it is important to understand your supervisor's expectations. S/he will likely provide instructions and guidance that will no doubt align with the program's expectations, but may also go beyond the program's guidelines. This is a good thing, as the program requirements are a minimum, but your supervisor has experience and knowledge that is (1) field specific and (2) tried and tested with other students.

### Exam Reading Lists
#### What are they? What are they for?
In my institution (French, Hispanic and Italian Studies at UBC), the comprehensive exam [reading lists](https://fhis.air.arts.ubc.ca/phd-comprehensive-examination-guidelines-french-hispanic-studies/) are meant to prepare students to be both a generalist in a broad field and a specialist in their chosen specific field. Composing the lists, reading the works, and completing the exam should move you toward a successful experience during the proposal phase of the PhD (and of course contribute to the composition of the dissertation). The lists, prepared in consultation with the supervisor and committee, will necessarily be broader than area covered by your dissertation, as they are comprised of both primary works and critical / theoretical texts that relate to the student's particular research interests, as well as an applicable wider context.

This broader context is important for a variety of reasons. First, you will be expected to teach outside of your specialty, and coursework and the comprehensive exams (as well as the MA) will contribute to making you a well-rounded scholar. Second, and most immediately pertinent, you must be able to situate your area of specialization in a broader context, to signal precursors, formal innovations, and literary dialogues. Finally, you will eventually need to articulate a second project (once you have that tenure-track position and are making progress on turning the dissertation into a book manuscript), and having a basis in a broader context will help you make inroads on thinking about that second monograph.

Composing the lists requires students to understand their research interests and have a general sense of where the dissertation is going (I purposely put that in the present progressive... the dissertation is already cooking when you're at the comprehensive exam stage!). They will also take various rounds of revisions between you and your supervisor, and then you and your committee members. This can be frustrating, but it's part of the process. Most importantly, having solid lists that relate to your future project will facilitate each of the subsequent stages.


#### Quick Tips

* #1 Rule: check your program-specific guidelines and your supervisor's expectations.
* Request examples of successful readings lists and proposals from your program. You should check with the Graduate Studies Director, who can provide you with examples or direct you to students who would be willing to share their lists.
* Before you even begin composing the lists, you should be able to articulate your research interests and define the tentative direction the dissertation will take. Some questions you should be able to answer: What time period and region / country / countries do you plan to study? What are the primary critical / theoretical disciplines you will engage with? Who are some of the principle authors you will write about? What are the genres / literary movements that interest you? What methodological approaches will your research entail?
* Be organized. Start a Google Doc or keep a notebook for notes.
* Communicate with your committee chair regularly. Once your chair communicates that your lists are ready to be revised by the committee, send them a copy and request their feedback on the lists.
* The secondary readings (literary criticism) should be primarily comprised of works written in the past twenty years, although you will need relevant canonical works.
* If you are reading this early in your PhD journey, begin thinking about how your coursework may be completed so as to be useful for the dissertation. For instance, if you have flexibility to choose the topic / texts of a final paper, select something that you may want to work on during the dissertation. If you're lucky, you might even walk away from coursework with an early version of a chapter.
* Create practice questions for yourself. 

#### Your Comps
Each student's experience with comps will differ based on their particular interests, their study habits, their relationship with the supervisor and committee, etc. The advice here is meant to be a general resource, but you no doubt will (and should!) develop your own approach to both composing and preparing for comps. Comps can certainly be stressful, but, in the best of circumstances, this should be an exciting stage, as you should be principally dedicated to becoming familar with foundational work related to your research interests.
