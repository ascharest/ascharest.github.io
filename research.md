* I specialize in 20th- and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction, as well as in broad comparative areas 
that reach into other disciplines and traditions: Latina/o Studies, critical theory, political philosophy, and border and 
diaspora studies. My research is animated by questions of political agency, economic precarity, and the violence that obtains 
throughout waning national modernity, as well as by the ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes burgeoning 
neoliberal globalization.

* My dissertation analyzed the novels of Chilean-Mexican-Catalunyan author Roberto Bolaño and Honduran-Salvadoran-US-Latino 
author Horacio Castellanos Moya as a means of conceptualizing the rise of what I call "post-national literature," which refers 
to works that comment upon and critique, both formally and thematically, the shifting dynamics of the 
nation state as neoliberal globalization becomes the dominant ordering system of world relations. To do so, I analyzed 
Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s engagement with literary and aesthetic traditions, particularly realism and the avant-garde, 
and I maintained that a dialectic emerges between their works and the literary past that opens a space to interrogate the place of 
aesthetic praxis as neoliberal globalization becomes ascendant. Finally, I examined Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s literary rejections 
of Leftist militant reason and discussed how their novels implicate the Left in the rise of neoliberal globalization. 

* My current book project draws on the work I began in my dissertation but shifts focus to consider how globalization is being 
leveraged—even embraced—by Latin American thinkers and artists as a means of critiquing and shaping world relations in the present epoch. 
Specifically, I examine the narrative fiction of authors Roberto Bolaño, Horacio Castellanos Moya, and Valeria Luiselli, and the work of 
installation artist Teresa Margolles. My research posits that these artists embrace the commodity status of their work as part of the global 
art market as a means of critiquing and destabilizing the boundaries between the Global North and South.

In April 2019, I had the pleasure of participating in a workshop and spending the day with Honduran-Salvadoran author Horacio Castellanos Moya, one of two authors whose corpus I examine at length in my dissertation project.
