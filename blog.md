Based on my experience as a Ph.D. student (2012-2019) and as Assistant Professor of Spanish (2019-present), I provide information and advice about preparing for the job market, professionalization as a graduate student, how to negotiate for jobs, etc. I study contemporary Latin American literatures and cultures through the lens of critical theory and continental philosophy, so my background is in the humanities with a focus on literature written in Spanish. This means some of the specifics on this blog (e.g., particular journals that I cite, conferences that I recommend, etc.) relate to my field, but you should be able to apply those pieces of advice to your . As always, if a suggestion provided here conflicts with something that your mentor(s)/advisor(s) tell you, ignore me!
