At LASA 2019, I organized the roundtable "Nuestra América through a Latinx Lens: Reading (with) Héctor Tobar." Attendees had a chance to hear about [Tobar](https://www.hectortobar.com)'s fifth book and most recent project, _The Last Great Road Bum_, and dialogue with Latinx literary scholars about pedagogy, activism, and research in our current political moment.
