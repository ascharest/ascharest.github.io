My students often ask for advice on preparing for the job market, so I compiled this [PDF](https://tamaraleemitchell.github.io/assets/research/JobMarketAdvice_TLM.pdf) based on my experience. I study Latin American literature, and some of the advice I provide is fairly discipline specific, but you can easily adjust the recommendations to fit your field. 

There are myriad wonderful sites and resources for graduate students looking to enter a career in academia. I suggest you check out different opinions, because there is not one correct path for getting a job. As always, if anything here contradicts your advisor(s), ignore me and listen to him/her/them. 

Here is one 2020 entry in _The Professor Is In_ that is particularly relevant to this topic: "[What Are Candidates Doing Wrong](https://theprofessorisin.com/2020/01/27/dispatches-from-the-front-what-candidates-are-doing-wrong-part-i-of-iii-do-your-homework-please-please/) (crowdsourced responses from recent search committee members)"
