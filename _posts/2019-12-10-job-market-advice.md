My students often ask for advice on preparing for the job market, so I compiled this [PDF](https://tamaraleemitchell.github.io/assets/research/JobMarketAdvice_TLM.pdf) based on my experience. I study Latin American literature, and some of the advice I provide is fairly discipline specific, but you can easily adjust the recommendations to fit your field. 

There are myriad wonderful sites and resources for graduate students looking to enter a career in academia. I suggest you check out different opinions, because there is not one correct path for getting a job. As always, if anything here contradicts your advisor(s), ignore me and listen to him/her/them.
